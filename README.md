# California Housing Linear Regression

## Overview
This project builds a **linear regression model** to predict California housing prices using a dataset from Kaggle. It demonstrates data preprocessing, encoding categorical variables, training, and evaluating the model using **MSE** and **R² score**.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle California Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Features include: longitude, latitude, median income, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, ocean proximity, etc.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training a linear regression model
- Evaluating model performance with **MSE** and **R²**
- Visualizing predictions vs actual values

## Results
- MSE: ~5,055,025,116  
- R²: 0.614  

The model explains ~61% of the variance in housing prices.
